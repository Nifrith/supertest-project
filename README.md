# API Testing Project
Project for learning how to work with jest/supertest on an API made with nodejs

# Nodejs
In order to work with an all new API, i've used express-generator to make a boilerplate
https://expressjs.com/es/starter/generator.html

For using it, install it using the next command:
```
npm install express-generator -g
```
To show the different options, use:
```
express -h 
```

To create the boilerplate:
```
express {{Project Location here}}
```

Finally, navigate to folder and install dependencies
```
cd {{Project location}}
npm install
```
